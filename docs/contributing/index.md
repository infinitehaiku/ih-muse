## Labels

We use a set of standardized labels to categorize issues and pull requests. Proper labeling helps in tracking progress, prioritizing tasks, and organizing contributions effectively.

### **Using Labels**

- **Issues:** When reporting or addressing an issue, apply the relevant labels to categorize the type of issue (e.g., bug, feature request).
- **Pull Requests:** Ensure your PRs are labeled appropriately based on the nature of the changes (e.g., fix, feature).

### **Syncing Labels**

Our workflow automatically syncs labels from the `.github/labels.yml` configuration. If you need to add or modify labels, please update the `labels.yml` file accordingly and submit a PR.

## Commit and PR Message Guidelines

To maintain a clean and understandable project history, we adhere to the **Conventional Commit** format for all commit messages and PR titles. This standardization facilitates automated tooling and ensures clarity in the purpose of changes.

### **Conventional Commit Format**

Each commit message should follow this structure:

```plaintext
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### **Conventional Commit Format Components:**

- **`<type>`**: Describes the category of the commit. Must be one of the following:

  - `feat`: A new feature.
  - `fix`: A bug fix.
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes.
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.).
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
  - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
  - `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
  - `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.
  - `revert`: Reverts a previous commit.

- **`<scope>`**: _(Optional)_ A noun describing a section of the codebase enclosed in parentheses. For example, `feat(auth): add login functionality`.

- **`<description>`**: A short, imperative description of the change.

#### **Conventional Commit Format Examples:**

- **Feature Addition:**

  ```plaintext
  feat(auth): add login functionality
  ```

- **Bug Fix:**

  ```plaintext
  fix(api): handle null responses gracefully
  ```

- **Documentation Update:**

  ```plaintext
  docs(readme): update installation instructions
  ```

- **Refactoring Code:**

  ```plaintext
  refactor(utils): simplify error handling
  ```

- **Chore:**

  ```plaintext
  chore(deps): update dependency lodash to v4.17.21
  ```

### **Pull Request Titles**

Your PR title should mirror your commit message format for consistency.

#### **Format:**

```plaintext
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### **Pull Request Titles Examples:**

- **Feature PR:**

  ```plaintext
  feat(auth): implement OAuth2 authentication
  ```

- **Bug Fix PR:**

  ```plaintext
  fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue on mobile
  ```

- **Documentation PR:**

  ```plaintext
  docs(api): add examples for new endpoints
  ```

### **Guidelines for Writing Commit Messages and PR Titles**

1. **Be Clear and Concise:**
   Ensure that your descriptions accurately reflect the changes made.

2. **Use the Imperative Mood:**
   Start your descriptions with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").

3. **Reference Issues and PRs:**
   If your commit or PR relates to an existing issue, reference it in the footer using `Closes #<issue-number>` or `Fixes #<issue-number>`.

4. **Avoid Subjective Language:**
   Stick to objective descriptions that describe the "what" and "why" of the changes.

## Labels and Automation

Our project utilizes automated workflows to manage labels and releases. Understanding how these systems work will help you contribute more effectively.

### **Label Management**

We use GitHub Actions to automatically sync and manage labels based on our `.github/labels.yml` configuration. This ensures consistency across all issues and pull requests.

- **Syncing Labels:**
  The `crazy-max/ghaction-github-labeler@v5` action syncs labels defined in `.github/labels.yml` with your GitHub repository. Ensure that any new labels you introduce are added to this configuration file.

- **Applying Labels Based on PR Titles:**
  Pull requests are automatically labeled based on their titles using the `bcoe/conventional-release-labels@v1` action. Ensure your PR titles follow the **Conventional Commit** format to benefit from this automation.

### **Release Management**

We use **Release Drafter** to automate the creation of release notes based on merged pull requests.

- **Release Drafter Configuration:**
  The configuration file `.github/release-drafter.yml` defines how release notes are generated, categorizing changes based on labels.

- **Automated Releases:**
  When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the `release-drafter/release-drafter@v5` action generates or updates a draft release, aggregating changes from merged PRs.

- **Publishing Packages:**
  Our CI/CD pipeline handles publishing Rust crates and Python packages. It includes checks to prevent publishing duplicate versions and ensures that releases are only created when new versions are available.

## Handling Labeling and Release Errors

### **Release Drafter Errors**

If you encounter errors related to Release Drafter, such as missing configuration files or invalid templates:

1. **Ensure Configuration File Exists:**
   Verify that `.github/release-drafter.yml` exists in the default branch and is correctly formatted.

2. **Validate YAML Syntax:**
   Use a YAML linter to ensure there are no syntax errors in your configuration.

3. **Use Supported Placeholders:**
   Ensure your `template` uses valid placeholders like `$CHANGES`, `$CATEGORIES`, and `$CONTRIBUTORS`.

### **Sync Labels Errors**

If syncing labels fails due to incorrect color codes or invalid configurations:

1. **Quote Color Codes:**
   Ensure all color codes in `.github/labels.yml` are quoted strings, especially if they are purely numeric.

   ```yaml
   - name: chore
     description: Maintenance tasks
     color: "999999"
   ```

2. **Include All Managed Labels:**
   Add commonly used labels like `good first issue` and `help wanted` to your `labels.yml` to prevent exclusion warnings.

   ```yaml
   - name: good first issue
     description: Good for newcomers
     color: "7057ff"
   - name: help wanted
     description: Extra attention is needed
     color: "008672"
   ```

3. **Review Workflow Permissions:**
   Ensure your GitHub Actions workflows have the necessary permissions to manage labels and issues.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To contribute to IH-Muse once it's open for contributions, you can prepare your development environment by following these typical steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the IH-Muse repository (<https://github.com/your-username/ih-muse>) on GitHub to your own account.

2. **Clone the Fork**: Clone your fork locally.

   ```bash
   cd <directory_in_which_repo_should_be_created>
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/ih-muse.git
   ```

3. **Navigate into the directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ih-muse
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   - **Docker**: Make sure you have Docker installed on your system as it may be used for running services such as databases or other dependencies.

     - Docker Installation: Visit <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>

   - **Poetry**: IH-Muse uses Poetry for dependency management. Install Poetry using the recommended method from the official documentation at <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>.

5. **Set Up the Project**: Inside the project directory, set up your local development environment using Poetry. This will install all dependencies, including those needed for development.

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

6. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**: After installing all dependencies, set up pre-commit hooks in your local repository. This ensures that code quality checks are automatically performed before each commit.

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

7. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Use Poetry to activate the virtual environment.

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

8. **Start Development**: You are now ready to start exploring the codebase. While we are not accepting contributions yet, you can familiarize yourself with the project structure and code.

   ```{attention}
   The Python docstrings will be rendered by MyST and `autodoc2`. Use Markdown to document them and any MyST formatting allowed. For examples, check the [MyST syntax cheat sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html), [Roles and Directives](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/roles-and-directives.html), and the complete directives references at [MyST docs](https://mystmd.org/guide/directives).

## Running Tests and Checking Coverage

IH-Muse aims to maintain a high standard of code quality, which includes thorough testing and maintaining good test coverage. Here’s how you can run tests and check coverage:

1. **Running Tests**: After setting up your development environment, you can run the tests to ensure everything is working as expected.

   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

   This command will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory.

2. **Checking Test Coverage**: To check how much of the code is covered by tests, use the `coverage` tool.

   - First, run the tests with coverage tracking:

     ```bash
     poetry run coverage run -m pytest
     ```

   - Then, generate a coverage report. There are two ways to view the coverage report:

     - For a summary in the console, use:

       ```bash
       poetry run coverage report
       ```

     - For a more detailed HTML report, use:

       ```bash
       poetry run coverage html
       ```

       This will generate a report in the `htmlcov` directory. You can open `htmlcov/index.html` in a web browser to view it.

Please aim to maintain or improve the test coverage with your contributions. It’s recommended to add tests for any new code or when fixing bugs.
